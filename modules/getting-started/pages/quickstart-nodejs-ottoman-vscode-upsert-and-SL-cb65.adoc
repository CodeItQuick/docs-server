= Couchbase Server Quickstart - Upsert and Lookup via Ottoman 2.6 & NodeJS SDK 2.6
:imagesdir: ../assets/images
:sourcedir: ../examples

[abstract]
Before we get started with Ottoman and Node JS, we need to ensure you have Couchbase up and running with a data bucket and two indexes in place for basic queries. Using SQL syntax and the Couchbase Query Workbench, we will create two indexes, a primary and adaptive index. After we upsert our records, these indexes will allow us to look up our documents with the Query API in Ottoman. 

== Prerequisites: Three Steps required to Query our Bucket

1. Setup Couchbase Server 6.5 and ensure it is running.

2. Create an empty bucket named "default".

3. Add a primary and adaptive index for our default bucket.

If you still need to perform these tasks please use one of the following:

* xref:quickstart-docker-image-manual-cb65-for-ottoman.adoc[5-minute Couchbase Docker Container Configuration]

== Step 1: Create The Ottoman Node JS Project

In this exercise, we will be working with the link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/node-ottoman[Ottoman ODM (Object Document Mapper)] in conjunction with the link:https://docs.couchbase.com/nodejs-sdk/2.6/start-using-sdk.html[NodeJS SDK v2.6].

NOTE: you can get to the Couchbase Server Web UI at any time by visiting link:https://localhost:8091[localhost:8091]. 

Let's first create a project directory named `first-query-ottoman`, change directories into that directory and initialize NPM:

```sh
mkdir first-query-ottoman && cd $_ && npm init
```

NOTE: The double ampersands (`&&`)are just a way of chaining multiple shell commands. The `$_` command simply captures our last used argument which in our case was the directory that we created.

Now with a node package manager and manifest (`package.json`) in place, let's add Couchbase and ottoman to our dependencies for the project:

```sh
npm install couchbase ottoman
```

Now we will create a file named `server.js` and launch Visual Studio Code:

```sh
touch server.js && code .
```

This command has set up a project directory and enabled npm, installed `couchbase` and `ottoman` as well as created a `server.js` file and finally opened up our VS Code editor to the project root. 

Let's open that `server.js` file, this is where we'll be adding our code.

Taking each code sample below, we will add each new block of code done after one another.

== Connecting to a Couchbase Bucket

Create a connection to our Couchbase Server running in Docker. Your password may be different, just swap out yours if it is different.

```js
var ottoman = require('ottoman')
var couchbase = require('couchbase')

var cluster = new couchbase.Cluster('localhost:8091')

cluster.authenticate('Administrator', 'password')
ottoman.bucket = cluster.openBucket('default')
```

== Creating an Ottoman Model

Create a model for our `User` document. It will get auto-created and stored in our already created `default` bucket in Couchbase. Once our model is set up, we can add a few initial documents to populate our bucket.

```js
var User = ottoman.model('User', {
  firstName: 'string',
  lastName: 'string',
  email: 'string'
})
```

This is a very simple model with only four fields, but we are starting with a simple example on purpose. Ottoman does support other data types like `boolean`, integer`, and `Date`. A model can also define indexes similar to the ones we set up manually. For now, we are going to skip letting Ottoman set up our indexes as we already have them in place.

== Create New User Documents

Here we are defining a few documents that we want to persist to our bucket, notice we are using the same document that we defined in our model.

```js
var user_perry = new User({
  firstName: 'Perry',
  lastName: 'Mason',
  email: 'perry.mason@acme.com'
})
var user_tom = new User({
  firstName: 'Major',
  lastName: 'Tom',
  email: 'major.tom@acme.com'
})
var user_jerry = new User({
  firstName: 'Jerry',
  lastName: 'Wasaracecardriver',
  email: 'jerry.wasaracecardriver@acme.com'
})
```

== Persist Documents to Our Bucket

Call Ottoman's `save()` method on each of these objects which will add them to our database so long as no errors occur.

```js
user_perry.save((err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log(`success: user ${user_perry.firstName} added!`)
})
user_tom.save((err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log(`success: user ${user_tom.firstName} added!`)
})
user_jerry.save((err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log(`success: user ${user_jerry.firstName} added!`)
})
```

Now that we have added the code to save (persist) each record to the database, let's run our app for the first time with Node:

```sh
node server
```

You should get three success messages in the console.

```sh
success: user Perry added!
success: user Major added!
success: user Jerry added!
```

If we open our Web UI at link:https://localhost:8091[localhost:8091] and navigate to the "Buckets" tab, we can see that two records were added to the `default` bucket. 

NOTE: You can edit the document in place by clicking the pencil icon or remove them individually with the trash icon. You can also edit the buckets and in the section "Advanced bucket settings" enable Flush. When flushed, all items in the bucket are removed. This is a quick way to remove all documents.

Let's remove these three documents, write some more code that will add the documents, and then turn around and query them.

== Write a Query with Ottoman's Query API

In Ottoman, we can retrieve records from our bucket using the adaptive index we have in place by calling the `find()` method.

```js
User.find({ lastName: 'Tom' }, { consistency: ottoman.Consistency.LOCAL },
  (err, items) => {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log('Finding Tom: ', JSON.stringify(items))
  }
)
```

The first two arguments to the `find()` method are `filter` and `options`. 

Instead of passing objects along as parameters, let's write our code to define the filter and options as objects first and then pass them into the function as arguments.

```js
var filters = { 
  lastName: 'Tom',
  firstName: 'Jerry'
}

var options = {
  consistency: ottoman.Consistency.LOCAL
}

User.find(filters, options,
  (err, items) => {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log('Found Tom and Jerry: ', JSON.stringify(items))
  }
)
```

NOTE: If we had a lot more data and we were expecting hundreds of records to be returned, we could page the results with our options to get the second page (pagination), like this:

```js
var options = {
  limit: 10,
  skip: 10
  consistency: ottoman.Consistency.LOCAL
}
```

Let's run Node again and now we should get the same three success messages and an object returned to us that we queried for:

```sh
node server
```

You should see the following in your command line:

```sh
success: user Perry added!
success: user Major added!
success: user Jerry added!
Query results:  [
  User {
    _id: '7dac3b61-a83f-4374-a545-c1fda64f17de',
    firstName: 'Major',
    lastName: 'Tom',
    email: 'major.tom@acme.com'
  }
]
```

Perfect, we now have the basics of Ottoman under our belt. If you would like to continue learning about Ottoman, I suggest checking out the link:http://ottomanjs.com/[Ottoman Documentation].

== Summary

We have created models in Ottoman, defined some documents, and persisted them to the database. We then subsequently looked them up using the built-in `find()` method which used the Ottoman Query API for Couchbase. We have not yet touched on indexes other than the fact that we created two of them during the docker and indexes section of the quickstart.

NOTE: If those indexes were not present, if we had not set them up or let Ottoman do it for us (an option we did not explore yet) we would get an error when running our application upon query:

```sh
"errors": [
  {
    "code": 4000,
    "msg": "No index available on keyspace default that matches your query. Use CREATE INDEX or CREATE PRIMARY INDEX to create an index, or check that your expected index is online."
  }
]
```

== Exercise Complete

Congratulations!  You have substantially engaged with the world's most powerful JSON document database using the most advanced SQL++ query technology. Know that our query language N1QL was run under the hood too but we did not have to write any N1QL yet. That's pretty powerful, Ottoman did all the heavy lifting for us!
